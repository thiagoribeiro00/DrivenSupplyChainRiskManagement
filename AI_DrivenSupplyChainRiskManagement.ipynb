For instance, with the introduction of the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), business operators can benefit from the Climate Change Law as CBAM puts a carbon price at the EU border, requiring importers to pay unless the imported goods have already been explicitly priced based on carbon emissions through compulsory carbon pricing mechanisms (ETS/Carbon Tax) at the exporting countries.\\\\\\\\n Whist obligations such as mandatory GHG reporting, potential inclusion in an ETS and the introduction of the Carbon Tax may increase operating costs, there are substantial opportunities for growth by the establishment of the Climate Change Fund offering access to financial assistance and loans for business operators engaged in climate change mitigation activities. In addition, the carbon credits registered or certified by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO) can be converted into allowances under the ETS, on the condition that such carbon credits meet the criteria and qualifications prescribed by the NCCC.\\\\\\\\n After a public hearing, the draft legislation would be reviewed by the Subcommittee on Climate Change Law, the NCCC, the Cabinet, the Council of State, and lastly the Parliament.\\\\\\\"}\\\", \\\"{\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"https://thailand.un.org/en/151103-achieving-just-transition-net-zero-economy-key-building-climate-resilience-thailand\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\uddfa\\\\\\\\ud83c\\\\\\\\uddf3\\\\\\\\u00a0Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund!\\\\\\\\nBreadcrumb\\\\\\\\nAchieving just transition to net-zero economy key to building climate-resilience in Thailand\\\\\\\\n11 October 2021\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u201cThe shift away from fossil fuel dependency and reducing carbon emissions are among the most pressing priorities, for which we have a finite window of opportunity to act,\\\\\\\\u201d said United Nations Resident Coordinator in Thailand, Ms. Gita Sabharwal.\\\\\\\\nBangkok, Thailand \\\\\\\\u2013 Business leaders representing Thailand\\\\\\\\u2019s major industries today joined the Global Compact Network Thailand (GCNT) Forum 2021 and United Nations in issuing a strong call to action by the private sector community on climate sustainability ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 in November in Glasgow.
